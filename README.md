#RSSReader 

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and itâ€™s is a simple, standardized content distribution method that can help you stay up-to-date with your favorite newscasts, blogs, websites, and social media channels. Instead of visiting sites to find new posts or subscribing to sites to receive notification of new posts.



A starter template for `Next.js` with `TailwindCSS` and `TypeScript` preconfigured. 

Paths have also been set up to compile from `/src`, making component imports go from
`../../../components/Nav` to `components/Nav`. :)

To use this template, clone the repository, or click "Use this template" on Github. 

Run `yarn` to download all dependencies, and `yarn dev` to start the development
environment.
